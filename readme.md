# Update on the results presented in the ISAP22 paper
1. core SNR derivation and independence from Pd and Bn
2. Pd for a single NESZ value, but for small and medium ships from DLR paper
3. Resolution area driven design still valid: show how this can be employed to do an antenna length vs power trade-off
4. Antenna length vs power trade-off for different swath widths.
